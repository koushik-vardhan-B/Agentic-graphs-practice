# ðŸ§  Agentic Graphs Practice

This repository contains my practice work for building **agent workflows** using **graphs** â€” a powerful approach to design modular, flexible, and reusable AI agent pipelines.  

## ðŸ“Œ What are Agentic Graphs?
Agentic graphs represent **agents** and their **tasks** as interconnected nodes in a directed graph structure.  
- **Nodes** â†’ Functions or agents that perform a specific operation.  
- **Edges** â†’ Define the flow of data/state between nodes.  
- **State** â†’ A shared structure (dictionary/class) that moves between nodes.  

By modeling an AI system as a graph:
- You can clearly define **order of execution**.
- Easily **add, remove, or replace** components.
- Run **parallel** or **conditional** paths.
- Debug more easily by visualizing each step.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LangGraph** (for building agent graphs)
- **LangChain** (optional integration with LLMs)
- **Custom AgentState** classes for structured data flow
